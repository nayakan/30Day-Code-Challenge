/*
 * The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a-b|. The maximum absolute difference 
 * between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two 
 * integers in elements .
 * The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elemts) for storing  
 * non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.
 * Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

 * A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
 * A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in N and stores 
 * it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
 * Constraints
    1 <= N <= 100
    1 <= elements[i] <= 100
